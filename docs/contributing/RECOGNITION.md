## Contribution Types We Recognize

| Type | Emoji | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| Code | `code` | Bug fixes, features, adapters |
| Documentation | `doc` | Guides, tutorials, corrections |
| Tests | `test` | Unit tests, integration tests |
| Ideas | `ideas` | Feature proposals, architecture suggestions |
| Bug Reports | `bug` | Detailed issue reports with repro steps |

## How Recognition Works

When your PR is merged, a maintainer will add you to CONTRIBUTORS.md. If you're not added within a week, ping us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/ysg8fphxUe) or open an issue.

Non-code contributions (case studies, configs, dialplan docs) get equal visibility. You don't need to write Python to be a valued contributor.
