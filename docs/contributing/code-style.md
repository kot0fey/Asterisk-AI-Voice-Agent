# Code Style

This project maintains coding standards across two documents:

- **[`Agents.md`](../../Agents.md)** — High-level project policies: canonical sources, deployment rules, release/merge flow, MCP integration.
- **[`CODING_GUIDELINES.md`](CODING_GUIDELINES.md)** — Code-level standards: Python style, tool/provider patterns, testing, documentation rules.

When in doubt, match the style of the surrounding code and keep changes minimal and reviewable.
